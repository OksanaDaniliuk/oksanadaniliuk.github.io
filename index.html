        <p>Social media dedicated to <strong>Oxie</strong>... and only <strong>Oxie</strong>... because she's a <strong>QUEEN</strong>. </p>
        <p>I'm currently a senior in the Graphic Design Program at Sac State minoring in Computer Sceince. I hope to graduate in May 2022 and move forward as a front end web developer or UX/UI Designer.</p>
        <p>I love watching movies, illustrating, enjoying the outdoors (whether we're kayaking, hiking, or sipping coffee in the yard -- it's a breathe of fresh air!). And honestly, I just can't wait to work from home, making the big bucks, doing what I love!</p>
